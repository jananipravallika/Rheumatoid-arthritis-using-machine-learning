# Rheumatoid-arthritis-using-machine-learning
Rheumatoid arthritis which is a persistent immune disorder that is affected at the one or more joints of the body parts due to growing age. 
Since the Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic disease that should be treated in primary stage of the disease
With the help of image processing and segmenting that can be easily identified and treated.
Image processing helps in differentiating the normal and abnormal characters of the captured images
This study enabled us to establish a proof of concept that infrared thermal imaging can detect the presence of RA in human subjects.
Demonstrated a complete working of RA software using image processing by clustering and segmenting the image when compared it detects in early age so that  it can be treated successfully.
